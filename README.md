### 🙋‍ What is Pegava?

Pegava is supposed to be a dating app. I made it back at the pandemic's beginning but was never released. So I'm making it open source so the community can take a look and maybe use it better. I rapidly refactored it recently to make sure things are up to date after more than a year without updates.

### 📲 Can I try the app?

Yes! Simply download the Expo app and scan the QR code below:
